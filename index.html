                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <article>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to build structure of a web page and its content.
                        For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.

                        <h3>HTML Elements</h3>     
                        <article>
                            An HTML file is made of elements. These elements are responsible for creating web pages and define content in that webpage.
                             An element in HTML usually consist of a start tag 'tag name', close tag 'tag name' and content inserted between them. 
                             Technically, an element is a collection of start tag, attributes, end tag, content between them.

                        <h3>Attributes</h3>
                        <article>
                            HTML attributes are special words which provide additional information about the elements or attributes are the modifier of the HTML element.
                            Each element or tag can have attributes, which defines the behaviour of that element.
                            Attributes should always be applied with start tag
                            The Attribute should always be applied with its name and value pair.
                            simply by their presence in the start tag of the element,[6] like the ismap attribute for the img element.[76]

                        <h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
                        <article>
                            Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. Elements such as 'header' ,
                             'footer' and 'article' are all considered semantic because they accurately describe the purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside them.
